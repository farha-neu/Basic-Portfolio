                   Hi! I am Farha Jawed. I completed my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering in 2015. I came to USA in 2017 to pursue my M.S. in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Boston. I am majoring in 
                   Human-Computer Interaction. I am interested in designing and developing interactive systems to support people, and for people to enjoy. Learning new skills
                   of web developement is important to accomplish the objective of enhancing user experience. I am doing a web development bootcamp
                   at UCLA-Extension in summer to learn newer and demanding skills of Web developement.
